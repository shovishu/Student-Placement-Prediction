# Student-Placement-Prediction
Placement of students is one of the most important objective of an educational institution. Reputation and yearly admissions of an institution invariably depend on the placements it provides it students with. That is why all the institutions, arduously, strive to strengthen their placement department so as to improve their institution on a whole. Any assistance in this particular area will have a positive impact on an institutionâ€™s ability to place its students. This will always be helpful to both the students, as well as the institution.

In this study, the objective is to analyse previous year's student's data and use it to predict the placement chance of the current students. This model is proposed with an algorithm to predict the same.

This model uses Random Forest Classification algorithm to predict that the student will be placed or not based on the following parameters #TENTH	#TWELTH	#CGPA	#BACKLOGS	#AMCAT.The data being used for the working of model is hypothetical and collected from various online resources.
